# Scientific Python Cookiecutter

Please see the original [NSLS-II repo](https://github.com/NSLS-II/scientific-python-cookiecutter). I forked their repo to personalize it for myself.

**[Documentation](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/)**

This repository contains a cookiecutter template for generating a scientific
Python project complete with CI testing and documentation.

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/NSLS-II/scientific-python-cookiecutter
```

Separately, beside the cookiecutter template, it contains
[tutorial documentation](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/)
on how to use this template to organize scientific Python code into a package
and use popular tools for testing, documentation, and maintenance.
